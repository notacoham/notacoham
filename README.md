# 👋 Hello, I'm Alex Cottam!
## 💻 About Me
I'm an iOS and Web Developer who loves building web and mobile apps, and CLI tools for myself and other devs. My journey in tech began with building my first ever website while in school, watching the page come to life, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and solve complex problems.

🔭 I’m currently working on a CLI Chat tool that allows devs to chat with each other in the command line.

🌱 I’m currently learning Django and Machine Learning.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that needs a backend! I am trying to improve my backend building skills.

💬 Ask me about AI integration and mobile app building w/ Swift or React Native.
